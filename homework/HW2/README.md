# HW2

Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). You should write your own code for convolutions (e.g., do not use SciPy's convolution function). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It should achieve at least 94% accuracy on the Test Set.
