# HW3

Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (C) data augmentation. For 10% extra credit, compare dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation. For full credit, the model should achieve 80-90% Test Accuracy.
